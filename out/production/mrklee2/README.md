# MRKLEE

The **M**odern **R**ight-re**K**ursive **L**anguage for **E**veryday **E**xpressions.

*Written and designed by Hunter James*

## Getting Started

This directory includes five tests (test1, test2, test3, test4, test5) to verify the accuracy of the Environment. 
Please note that test5 is *intended to fail* on line 16 due to a syntax error and will terminate with a nonzero error code.

### Prerequisites

Java version 7.0 or later. To check your version, use the command:

```
java -version
```

### Testing the Environment

To run a pre-existing test, use "make" alongside the test name.

```
make test1
```

Repeat for all five tests.

To run a test with custom input, enter the command "Recognizer" and the file path.

```
Recognizer other_test.mrk
```

Note once again that test5 is *intended to fail* on line 16 due to a syntax error and will terminate with a nonzero error code.

## Versioning

I am using [GitHub](https://github.com/hunterriffic) for version control. The *mrklee* repository is currently private, 
but will be made public after its release in the Spring.
